# license-plate-detection

This project is a license plate detection system for moving vehicles. It uses the YOLOv5 object detection model to identify vehicles in a video stream, followed by OpenCV and EasyOCR for license plate detection and recognition. The project includes the collection of a custom dataset of license plates to improve the model's accuracy.
